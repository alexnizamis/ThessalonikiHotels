ThessalonikiHotels
==================

It's a very simple android app. My first app. I had a Special Topic/Project with a Professor at university (2012). 
To develop a simple app which will read a list of hotels from Thessaloniki city from Booking.com. Then will keep only some of them which fullfill
some criteria such as distance from city center and money per room.From these hotels the algorithm which i made must keep only the optimal one. 
For example if criteria were 500meters and 100€ and there are a Hotel with distance 400m and cost 80€ and other one with distance 450m and cost 85€ 
the app will print to the output list only the first.
So we had ( random example numbers) 30 hotels in the list which were the optimal and not 200 
which were the hotels that matches the searching criteria.
This code propably isn't work now as a result of the changes at Booking's HTML code.
